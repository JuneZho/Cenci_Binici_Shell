# Cenci_Binici_Shell
CS406: Operating Systems | Project = Write a Shell in C

The Cenci_Binici_Shell was written in only C and creates a minishell that can be used to run commands similar to how a normal terminal would run. The minishell can be run by running terminal commands in relation to the Makefile that is included in the src folder.

To run the lsh: Open up a terminal window and change directory to be inside the project "src" folder. After that, run the following sequence of commands:
|------------------------------
| user> make
| .
| .
| .
| user> cd ../install/bin/
| user> ./lsh (STARTS THE SHELL)
| lsh>
|-------------------------------

Afterwords the user will be inside the lsh and can run commands designated and described within the minishell.

The man page for the minishell can be found within the /src/man/ folder. This can be run within the lsh minishell with the following command:
|-----------------------------
| lsh> man ../../src/man/./lsh
|-----------------------------

After that you can refer to the man page for any help with commands to use!
Good luck and happy processing!
